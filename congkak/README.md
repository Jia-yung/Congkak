# Congkak

Congkak is a Mancala game of Malay origin played primarily in South-east Asia. This is a slightly different version of the game since its based on an assignment from my University. The game is developed completely using the [Java Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).
